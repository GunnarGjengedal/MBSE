In order to run a experiment, simply input the desired testing parameters.
The current parameters are:
Number of good robots, number of bad robots, number of drones and the size of the field.
 
Good and bad robots have been defined based on what the group considers currently realistic parameters.
However this could be changed in order to experiment on different kinds of robots.
